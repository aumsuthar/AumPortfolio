                    <h2>AI Augmented Solution to Survey High Radiation Facilities</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I'm excited to share with you a project that I worked on which was published in JaCOW through the MEDSI 2020 conference. The project involved designing and building a robot capable of surveying high radiation facilities using advanced sensors and technology.</p>
                <p>We utilized the Intel Realsense LIDAR camera, FLIR Lepton, and the DonkeyCar framework to create a robot that could navigate through high radiation environments while collecting valuable data. The robot was equipped with the necessary safety features to ensure that it could operate safely in such environments, without posing a risk to human operators.</p>
				<p>By using advanced sensors and technology, we were able to collect precise data in real-time and use it to make informed decisions about how to improve the safety and efficiency of these facilities. The project was challenging but incredibly rewarding, and I'm proud of what our team was able to accomplish.</p>
				<p>Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills and knowledge in robotics and technology to a real-world problem. I'm excited to see how our findings can be used to make a positive impact in the industry, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on such an exciting project.</p>
