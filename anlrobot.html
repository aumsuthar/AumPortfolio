                    <h2>AI Augmented Solution to Survey High Radiation Facilities</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I'm excited to share with you a project that I worked on which was published in JaCOW through the MEDSI 2020 conference. The project involved designing and building a robot capable of surveying high radiation facilities using advanced sensors and technology.</p>
                <p>I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. Whether it's through internships, research projects, or extracurricular activities, I'm always striving to learn and develop new skills. My ultimate goal is to make a difference in the world by using science and technology to solve some of our biggest challenges.</p>
